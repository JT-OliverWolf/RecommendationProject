# RecommendationProject
This project is part of the Design of AI Systems course at Chalmers University of Technology.

My role in this project is to implement a recommendation system using Python and write a document.

I've chosen to implement it with two methods: the K-nearest neighbor and the matrix factorization-based method.

In-depth details can be found in the report file and the notebook.

In the report, I've truncated the part where I didn't work on, which is a summarization of a research paper, and only included the part where I did it myself.
